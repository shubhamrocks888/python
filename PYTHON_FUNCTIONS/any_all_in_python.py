Truth table :-

                                    any         all

All true values                     True        True
All false values                    False       False
One True(all others are False)      True        False
One False(all others are True)      True        False
Empty                               False       True


##Any and All are two built ins provided in python used for successive And/Or.


                                '''Any'''

Returns true if any of the items is True. It returns False if empty or all are false.
Any can be thought of as a sequence of OR operations on the provided iterables.
It short circuit the execution i.e. stop the execution as soon as the result is known.

Syntax : any(list of iterables)

# Since all are false, false is returned 
print (any([False, False, False, False]))       # Output: False

# Here the method will short-circuit at the 
# second item (True) and will return True. 
print (any([False, True, False, False]))        # Output: True

# Here the method will short-circuit at the 
# first (True) and will return True. 
print (any([True, False, False, False]))        # Output: True


                                '''All'''
Returns true if all of the items are True (or if the iterable is empty). All can be thought
of as a sequence of AND operations on the provided iterables. It also short circuit the
execution i.e. stop the execution as soon as the result is known.

Syntax : all(list of iterables)

# Here all the iterables are True so all 
# will return True and the same will be printed 
print (all([True, True, True, True]))               # Output: True

# Here the method will short-circuit at the 
# first item (False) and will return False. 
print (all([False, True, True, False]))             # Output: False

# This statement will return False, as no 
# True is found in the iterables 
print (all([False, False, False]))                  # Output: False

Practical Examples:

# This code explains how can we 
# use 'any' function on list 
list1 = [] 
list2 = [] 

# Index ranges from 1 to 10 to multiply 
for i in range(1,11): 
	list1.append(4*i) 

# Index to access the list2 is from 0 to 9 
for i in range(0,10): 
	list2.append(list1[i]%5==0) 

print('See whether at least one number is divisible by 5 in list 1=>') 
print(any(list2)) 

Output:
See whether at least one number is divisible by 5 in list 1=>
True

# Illustration of 'all' function in python 3 

# Take two lists 
list1=[] 
list2=[] 

# All numbers in list1 are in form: 4*i-3 
for i in range(1,21): 
	list1.append(4*i-3) 

# list2 stores info of odd numbers in list1 
for i in range(0,20): 
	list2.append(list1[i]%2==1) 

print('See whether all numbers in list1 are odd =>') 
print(all(list2))

Output:
See whether all numbers in list1 are odd =>
True
