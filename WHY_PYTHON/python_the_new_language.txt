1.  Reason for increasing popularity:

    1.  Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing
    2.  Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.
    3.  Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.
    4.  There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.
    5.  Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.

2.  LANGUAGE FEATURES;

    1.  Interpreted-->There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
                      Directly run the program from the source code.
                      Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes
                      which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.

    2.  Platform Independent-->Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.

    3.  Free and Open Source-->Redistributable. 

    4.  Simple-->Closer to English language;Easy to Learn.  

    5.  Robust-->Exceptional handling features
                 Memory management techniques in built

    6.  Rich Library Support.

    7.  Pros-->Ease of use.
               Multi-paradigm Approach.

    8.  Cons-->Slow speed of execution compared to C,C++.
               Absence from mobile computing and browsers.
